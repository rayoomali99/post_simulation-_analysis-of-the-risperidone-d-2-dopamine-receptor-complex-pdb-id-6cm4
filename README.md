## 📈 Post-Simulation Analyses

### 1. Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD)
![RMSD Backbone](rmsd.png)  
![RMSD Ligand](rmsd_lig.png)

- **Files:** `rmsd.xvg`, `rmsd_lig.xvg`
- The **protein backbone RMSD** stabilized around **0.8 nm**, indicating structural equilibrium after initial fluctuations.  
- The **ligand RMSD** remained around **4–5 nm**, showing flexible yet retained binding within the pocket.  
- → **Conclusion:** The receptor reached dynamic stability, and the ligand maintained a consistent orientation.

---

### 2. Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF)
![RMSF Plot](rmsf.png)

- **File:** `rmsf.xvg`
- The RMSF plot revealed localized flexibility around **residues 900–1100**, likely corresponding to loop regions.  
- Most residues showed fluctuations below **0.4 nm**, suggesting overall backbone rigidity.  
- → **Interpretation:** Minimal fluctuations reflect a stable receptor conformation during binding.

---

### 3. Radius of Gyration (Rg)
![Rg Plot](rog.png)

- **File:** `gyrate.xvg`
- The average **Rg value (~2.9 nm)** remained stable throughout the trajectory.  
- Slight variations across RgX, RgY, and RgZ axes confirmed compact folding.  
- → **Conclusion:** The receptor complex retained structural compactness with no significant unfolding.

---

### 4. Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA)
![SASA Plot](sasa.png)

- **File:** `sasa.xvg`
- SASA values fluctuated mildly around **300–350 nm²**, indicating minimal solvent exposure variation.  
- → **Interpretation:** The stable SASA profile supports consistent tertiary structure and solvent shielding.

---

### 5. Hydrogen Bonds (H-Bonds)
![Hbond Plot](hbond.png)

- **File:** `hbond.xvg`
- Hydrogen bonding between the receptor and Risperidone was relatively sparse but recurrent, averaging **1 bond** near 4 ns.  
- → **Insight:** Although transient, these H-bonds contribute to maintaining ligand anchoring within the pocket.

---

### 6. Protein–Ligand Distance
![Distance Plot](dis.png)

- **File:** `dist_LIG_PROT.xvg`
- The center-of-mass distance stabilized around **3.5–4 nm** after the initial 1 ns.  
- → **Interpretation:** The ligand settled into a stable binding pose with minimal drift.

---

### 7. Protein–Ligand Contacts
![Contacts Plot](contact.png)

- **File:** `contacts_LIG_PROT.xvg`
- The number of atom–atom contacts (< 0.6 nm) increased sharply up to ~2000 and then plateaued.  
- → **Conclusion:** Formation of stable hydrophobic and polar interactions confirming persistent binding.

---

### 8. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
![PCA Plot](pca.png)

- **Files:** `proj.xvg`, `pc1.xvg`, `pc2.xvg`
- PCA revealed significant motion along **PC1 and PC2** vectors, reflecting the global collective dynamics of the receptor.  
- → **Observation:** The transition between conformational states was limited, confirming an equilibrated ensemble.

---

### 9. Free Energy Landscape (FEL)
![FEL Plot](fel.png)

- **File:** `fel.xpm`
- The **Gibbs energy landscape** exhibited a major low-energy basin (blue–green region) suggesting a dominant, stable conformation.  
- → **Conclusion:** The system maintained a single energetically favorable state throughout the simulation.
